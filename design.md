## Introduction
### Objective

The project aims to build an AI-integrated network traffic analyzer that generates detailed thread reports from captured network traffic (pcap files) and offers associated functionalities such as live monitoring and selective interaction with target sites. The tool will empower a large language model (LLM) to interpret and generate reports based on network traffic analysis data, leveraging a collection of modern libraries and protocols.
### Scope

The project covers:

    Pcap file ingestion and analysis.
    Integration with an AI service for report generation.
    Live network traffic monitoring.
    Optional deep packet inspection (DPI).
    Outgoing traffic generation with sensitive traffic obfuscation.
    Use of a tool/call mechanism through JSON-RPC.

## Architecture Overview
### High-Level Architecture

The overall system is composed of the following components:

User Interface (UI):

Implemented with PySide6, offering an intuitive GUI for end-user interactions. The UI will provide options to import pcap files, configure live monitoring, and interact with AI-generated reports and filters.

Network Traffic Analysis Layer:

Utilizing Scapy for packet capture and analysis, this layer processes both imported pcap files and live network data. It will isolate specific traffic patterns and generate data structures that can be parsed and visualized.

Visualization & Analytics:

With Matplotlib or PyQtGraph along with numpy and pandas, the system will provide visual insights. Carefully selected libraries aim to avoid performance overhead while ensuring robust visualization.

AI Integration:

A tool or function-calling mechanism based on JSON-RPC will be used for secure and structured communication with the AI backend. The AI service (accessed via an API using the requests library) interprets analysis results and generates human-readable reports.

Config and Serialization:

Critical configuration files—including potentially sensitive user or service settings—are safely de/serialized via a Rust integration (using pyo3), ensuring robust, type-safe operations.

Optional Modules:

    Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): An optional component for more granular analysis.
    Outgoing Traffic Generation: Module to simulate traffic while obfuscating sensitive patterns.

### Data Flow Diagram

    For pcap File Processing:
        User imports a pcap file through the UI.
        Scapy extracts packets and constructs data objects.
        Data is fed into the visualization layer.
        The extracted information is formatted for JSON-RPC calls.
        AI service receives data → returns a generated report.
        Report is displayed in the UI.

    For Live Monitoring:
        The system captures live packets.
        Analysis is done in real-time.
        User-defined filters are generated by the AI based on natural language instructions.
        The filtered data triggers notifications or actions (e.g., suspending packets).

    For Outgoing Traffic Generation:
        The system generates traffic while modifying characteristics to hide sensitive patterns.
        Logs this activity and interacts with an AI agent for additional analysis if needed.

## Detailed Component Design
> [!NOTE]
> This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as package manager(instead of pip)  

### User Interface (PySide6)

    Main Window:

    Contains sections for importing files, live traffic visualization, and report display.

    Controls and Menus:

    Include actions to load pcap files, start/stop live monitoring, and settings to customize AI interactions and filtering rules.

### Network Traffic Analysis (Scapy)

    Packet Capture Logic:

    Use Scapy to read pcap files or capture live packets.

    Extraction and Preprocessing:

    Parse relevant data fields (source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, timestamps) and apply filtering rules as set by the user and AI-generated requirements.

    Event-Driven Alerts:

    Monitor for rule triggers. On detection, log events and interact with the AI for further instruction.

### Visualization (Matplotlib / PyQtGraph, Numpy, Pandas)

    Data Processing:

    Use Pandas and Numpy to transform packet data into charts and graphs.

    Rendering:

    Depending on performance considerations, use:
        PyQtGraph for real-time plotting scenarios (especially for live monitoring) to reduce overhead.
        Matplotlib for static report compilations.

    Interactive Dashboards:

    Provide drill-down capabilities to inspect specific network events and detected anomalies.

### AI Integration & JSON-RPC Mechanism

    JSON-RPC Protocol:
        Define standardized JSON-RPC requests and responses for function calls.
        The protocol will facilitate interaction between the application and the AI agent.

    Tooling Integration Workflow:
        Data (from packet analysis) is wrapped into a JSON-RPC request.
        The AI service interprets the data and executes relevant functions (e.g., generating an overview report, producing filter rules).
        AI returns the output which the system then interprets and displays via the UI.

    Error Handling and Retries:

    Incorporate robust error handling and retry mechanisms for network/API failures.

### Configuration Management (pyo3/Rust Integration)

    Safety and Robustness:

    Use Rust (integrated via pyo3) to handle serialization/deserialization of config files safely, preventing common pitfalls related to data integrity and memory safety.

    Config File Management:

    Store user preferences, filter definitions, and other critical runtime configurations using a secure format (e.g., JSON or TOML). Rust ensures that the config handling is efficient and secure.

### Optional Modules

    Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):
        Will be implemented as an optional module.
        DPI functions provide enhanced analysis, triggering alerts or deep logging when encountering specific traffic signatures.

    Outgoing Traffic Generation:
        Simulates traffic patterns while sanitizing sensitive details.
        The module logs all outgoing communications and interacts with the AI for pattern analysis.


## Dependencies and Libraries

    PySide6:

    For rendering the graphical user interface.

    Scapy:

    For parsing and capturing network packets.

    Matplotlib / PyQtGraph:

    For visualization; PyQtGraph is recommended for real-time plotting.

    Numpy and Pandas:

    For data processing and structuring network data.

    Requests:

    For making HTTP calls to the AI service.

    pyo3:

    For integrating Rust modules, primarily for safe configuration management.

## Workflow Scenarios
### Generating Reports from a pcap File

    User imports a pcap file via the UI.
    Scapy processes the pcap file and extracts relevant packet data.
    Data is preprocessed and visualized.
    A JSON-RPC call is made to the AI agent with this processed data.
    The AI agent processes instructions (looping through function/tool calls) and returns a formatted report.
    The report is displayed in the UI.

### Live Monitoring and Dynamic Filter Generation

    User initiates live monitoring.
    Real-time packet capture via Scapy is performed.
    AI interprets user-defined natural language requirements to generate filter rules; these rules are immediately applied.
    Any matched traffic triggers alerts/logs.
    On rule triggers, packet details (including suspended packets) are sent to the AI for further analysis.

### Outgoing Traffic Generation

    User defines target site and traffic criteria.
    The system tests accessibility and creates outgoing traffic patterns.
    Sensitive traffic characteristics are hidden.
    Results are logged and optionally analyzed by AI using a workflow similar to the report generation.

## Future Enhancements

    Enhanced DPI Module:

    Further development of deeper packet analysis techniques, possibly integrating machine learning for anomaly detection.

    Expanded AI Intelligence:

    Allow the AI to learn from user interactions to improve report quality and accuracy over time.

    Modular Plugin Ecosystem:

    Supporting community-developed plugins for additional protocol analysis or specialized reporting.

## Conclusion

The system is designed to integrate network traffic analysis with AI-driven insights using cutting-edge libraries and technologies. Its modular architecture, robust error handling, and interactive UI make it both flexible and powerful for network monitoring and threat analysis. The use of JSON-RPC for tool integration ensures a standardized communication mechanism, while the optional Rust-based configuration module ensures reliability and safety in configuration management.
